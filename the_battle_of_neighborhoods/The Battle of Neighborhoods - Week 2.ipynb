    "New business owner(s) who want to open a restaurant in Toronto area\n",

    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to explore the various neighborhoods in Toronto using location data to help Target Audience make an informated decision about the area in which they want to open a new restaurant business. This project will provide them data about competion, neighborhood, population etc.,\n",

    "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada, with a population of 2,731,571 as of 2016. Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto is a prominent centre for music,theatre,motion picture production,and television production, and is home to the headquarters of Canada's major national broadcast networks and media outlets. Its varied cultural institutions, which include numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 43 million tourists each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdale, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diverse population and a vast geographical area means that there will be intense competition among businesses to make maximum profit by attracting a lot of customers. This project will help solve that problem using location data by enabling new business owner(s) with insights about various neighborhoods, competition, population etc.,\n",
